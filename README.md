# Automated_CEG_Creation
This project aims at developing an algorithm for the automated transfer of structured requirements / pseudo code into Cause Effect Graphs (CEG). The algorithm comprises two functionalities: 1) syntax analysis of the pseudo code by means of ANTLR and 2) semantic analysis of the parse tree by a implemented visitor pattern.
